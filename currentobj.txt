OBJECTIVE: Implement Google reCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot") on a new public Contact form with backend verification.

IF NO PUBLIC FORM EXISTS:
- Create a minimal public contact form at /contact/ using a Django template + Django view.
- The form should POST to the same route.
- Do not create database models; do not create migrations.
- On successful submit: show a success message (and optionally log the submission to console).
- On failed captcha: show a clear error message and do not accept the submission.

FILES YOU MAY MODIFY/CREATE:
- config/settings.py (env var reads only)
- directory/urls.py (add a contact route)
- directory/views.py (contact view + captcha verification)
- directory/templates/directory/contact.html (new template)
- directory/static/... (ONLY if needed for small styling)
- Do not add new dependencies.

RECAPTCHA REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use reCAPTCHA v2 checkbox (not v3).
2. Do NOT hardcode keys.
3. Read RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY and RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY from environment variables.
4. Backend verification must POST to Google's siteverify endpoint.
5. If verification fails, reject submission with user-visible error.

DELIVERABLES:
- Implement the /contact/ page, route, template, and POST handling.
- Implement backend verification.
- Provide step-by-step instructions to create reCAPTCHA keys and set env vars locally and on Render.
- Provide verification commands to run locally.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Ask before touching any files outside the allowed list.
- Keep changes minimal and localized.
