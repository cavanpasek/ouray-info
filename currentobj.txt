OBJECTIVE: Front-end polish changes (minimal edits). Remove the Explore category section, adjust colors, fix encoding, and simplify detail-page rating display.

TASK 1 — Remove Explore category section, keep Explore nav as a scroll link
- Omit/remove the entire Explore category/section that was added on the page (do not display an “Explore” content block anywhere).
- Keep the “Explore” item in the top nav, but change its behavior to ONLY scroll/jump to where the Coffee section starts.
  - Implement as an anchor link to the Coffee section (e.g., href="#coffee" or the correct existing anchor).
  - Add/ensure the Coffee section has the correct id for the anchor target.
- Keep top nav centered and only containing: Explore | Contact | Bookmarked.

TASK 2 — Attractions text color to dark blue (palette-consistent)
- On the Attractions category section, update the subtitle text:
  “rails, sights, experiences, and local gems.”
  - Set this subtitle font color to a DARK BLUE that matches the existing palette (use an existing CSS variable/color if available; do not invent a random blue).
  - Ensure it remains readable over the snowy background (adjust opacity/weight if needed but keep color dark blue).

TASK 3 — Other category background to dark blue (palette-consistent)
- Update the background of the bottom “Other” category block/section to a DARK BLUE from the existing palette.
- Ensure the “Other / Everything not yet categorized” text stays readable (likely white).
- Keep spacing and layout unchanged; just update the background color.

TASK 4 — Fix Google star character encoding on cards
- Business cards in the Other category show broken text: “Google â˜… 4.7 (157)”
- Replace the star rendering so it uses a safe Unicode star or HTML entity:
  - Preferred: “Google ★ 4.7 (157)”
  - Or use “&#9733;” for the star so it never mojibakes.
- Ensure this is fixed across all categories/cards (not just Other).

TASK 5 — Detail page rating display: remove star visuals, keep linked “Read on Google”
- On the business detail page, remove the visual star fill/***** display entirely (no star component for ratings).
- Replace the Google line with this exact clean format:
  Google: "4.7" * - 157 reviews
  - Keep “Read on Google” underlined and as a link to that business’s Google reviews page (same link target currently used).
  - Place “Read on Google” at the end of the Google line or directly beneath it (whichever is more elegant), but keep it obvious and clickable.
- For ouray.info line:
  - Also remove star visuals; show a clean numeric rating and review count if reviews exist, or:
    “ouray.info: No ouray.info reviews yet”
- Keep typography consistent and elegant; minimal layout changes.

CONSTRAINTS
- Minimal file changes; reuse existing palette variables.
- No new dependencies.
- Do not change backend review logic; only adjust rendering/copy/anchors/styles.

DELIVERABLES
- List exact files you will modify before implementing.
- Implement all requested changes.
- Provide quick test checklist:
  - Home: Explore scrolls to Coffee, no Explore section exists
  - Attractions subtitle is dark blue and readable
  - Other section background is dark blue and readable
  - Cards show “Google ★ …” (no â˜… encoding)
  - Detail page shows numeric rating lines (no star visuals) + “Read on Google” link intact
