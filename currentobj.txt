Add email delivery for the contact form submissions.

Goal:
- When a contact form submission passes reCAPTCHA verification, send the message via email.

Recipients:
- cavanpasek@gmail.com
- keatonn@ourayschool.org
- oliverc@ourayschool.org

Requirements:
- Do NOT add new Python dependencies.
- Use Django’s built-in email utilities (django.core.mail).
- Do NOT store messages in the database.
- Do NOT expose email addresses in templates.
- Keep changes minimal and localized.

Implementation details:
- Configure email settings using environment variables only (no hardcoded credentials).
- Use a reasonable subject line like: "New Ouray Info Contact Form Submission".
- Email body should include:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
- Only send the email after reCAPTCHA verification succeeds.
- If email sending fails, show a user-visible error and do not silently discard the message.

Files you may modify:
- config/settings.py (email configuration via env vars only)
- directory/views.py (send email on successful submission)

After implementation:
- List the exact files changed.
- Tell me which environment variables I need to set locally and on Render.
- Tell me how to verify the email sending works.
