OBJECTIVE: Add a single “Deals” pill row on the business detail page and enable admins to manage deals in the backend. Keep changes minimal and safe.

SCOPE (DO ONLY THIS)
1) Business detail page UI:
- On the business details page where the pill rows currently show:
  Address
  Phone
  Website
- Add ONE additional pill row directly below “Website” labeled:
  Deals
- The “Deals” pill should match the exact styling/layout of the existing pill rows.

Behavior:
- If the business has an active deal, display a short deal string on the right side of the “Deals” row.
  - Show: deal title (preferred) OR deal code if title is blank.
  - Keep it one line; truncate with ellipsis if long.
- If the business has no active deal, display “None” (or leave blank if that looks more elegant—choose the cleaner option, but do not crash).

2) Admin/back-end:
- Allow admins to add/edit deals for a business from the Django admin.
- Minimal backend is fine:
  Option A (simplest): Add fields directly on Business:
    - deal_title (CharField blank=True)
    - deal_details (TextField blank=True) [optional, can skip if not needed]
    - deal_code (CharField blank=True) [optional]
    - deal_expires_at (DateTimeField null=True blank=True) [optional]
    - deal_is_active (BooleanField default=True)
    - Active deal if deal_is_active and (deal_expires_at is null or deal_expires_at > now) and deal_title not empty
  Option B (still simple, preferred if already have/expect multiple deals): Create Deal model with FK to Business and admin inline, but ONLY if it stays minimal.
- Choose the approach that requires the least code and least UI work while meeting the requirement “allow admin page to add deals”.

Constraints:
- No new dependencies.
- Keep changes limited to the business detail view/template, models/admin, and minimal CSS only if necessary.
- Do NOT change any other pages (no /deals page, no cards badges, no sorting changes).

Deliverables:
- List the exact files you will modify before implementing.
- Implement the deal backend + admin editability.
- Implement the “Deals” pill row on the detail page.
- Add/run migrations if you add model fields or a new model.
- Provide a quick test checklist:
  - Add deal in admin → appears in Deals row
  - Expired/inactive deal does not appear (if expiration implemented)
  - Business with no deal does not crash
