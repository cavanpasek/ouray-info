OBJECTIVE: Add a single “Deals” pill row on the business detail page and enable admins to add text for the pill, similar to how admins can add a phone number or website through ouray.info/admin. Keep changes minimal and safe.

SCOPE (DO ONLY THIS)
1) Business detail page UI:
- On the business details page where the pill rows currently show:
  Address
  Phone
  Website
  Deals

Current Behavior:
- If the business has a deal, display a short deal string on the right side of the “Deals” row.
- If the business has no deal, display “None” (or leave blank if that looks more elegant—choose the cleaner option, but do not crash).

2) Admin/back-end:
- Allow admins to add/edit deals for a business from the Django admin.
- Minimal backend is optimal, similar to how website and phone are setup:

Constraints:
- No new dependencies.
- Keep changes limited to the business detail view/template, models/admin, and minimal CSS only if necessary.
- Do NOT change any other pages (no /deals page, no cards badges, no sorting changes).

Deliverables:
- List the exact files you will modify before implementing.
- Implement the deal backend + admin editability.
- Add/run migrations if you add model fields or a new model.
- Provide a quick test checklist:
  - Add deal in admin → appears in Deals row
  - Business with no deal does not crash
