OBJECTIVE: Front-end/nav + sorting + category layout + review text polish (UI only). Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing design language. No new dependencies. No database/schema changes unless absolutely necessary to add the new “Attractions” category.

TASK 1 — Top navigation: condense + center
- On the home page top navigation row, replace the separate links “Coffee”, “Restaurants”, “Shopping” with a single nav item labeled “Explore”.
- Keep “Contact” and “Bookmarked” as separate nav items.
- Resulting nav items: Explore | Contact | Bookmarked
- Center these three items horizontally on the page (not left-aligned, not spaced weirdly).
- “Explore” should navigate to the section where category links/tiles/cards can be accessed (choose the cleanest behavior):
  - Option A: anchor jump to the categories section (preferred if you already use anchors)
  - Option B: open a small dropdown menu listing Coffee / Restaurants / Shopping (only if you can do it elegantly with minimal JS/CSS; otherwise use anchor jump)
- Ensure mobile layout still looks clean (wrap gracefully if needed).

TASK 2 — Sort dropdown options (simplify)
- Update the Sort dropdown label:
  - Rename “Top Rated (Ouray)” to “Top Rated (ouray.info)”
- Remove the “Most Reviewed (Ouray)” option entirely.
- Final dropdown options should be ONLY:
  1) Top Rated (ouray.info)  [default]
  2) Top Rated (Google)
  3) A–Z
- Ensure the sorting backend mapping still works and does not reference removed options.

TASK 3 — Add “Attractions” category + rearrange blocks
- Add a new category: “Attractions”.
- Update the home page category sections so:
  - “Attractions” becomes the category that sits over the snowy mountains image where “Other” currently is.
  - “Attractions” heading/subheading text should be BLUE (choose the same blue accent used elsewhere; ensure readable over snowy image).
  - Move “Other” into its own new solid-color block section below (a new category section like the others).
  - Since “Other” is no longer over the snowy background, set “Other / Everything not yet categorized” text to WHITE like the other category headings.
- Ensure clicking “Attractions” shows businesses from that category like the others.
- If categories are model-backed/enumerated:
  - Add “Attractions” to the allowed category choices and update any fixtures/admin forms accordingly (minimal change; no redesign).
  - If categories are not model-backed, update the template logic accordingly.

TASK 4 — Review text copy + details page elegance
A) Business cards
- If a business has 0 approved ouray.info reviews, replace the card text:
  - From: “No reviews yet”
  - To: “No ouray.info reviews yet”

B) Business detail page rating blocks (make more elegant)
- Replace the current verbose layout:
  - “No reviews yet”
  - “Google 122 reviews 4.80 Read on Google”
- With a cleaner, consistent two-line (or two-row) presentation:
  - ouray.info: ★ 4.5 · 12 reviews
  - Google: ★ 4.8 · 122 reviews (Read on Google link optional, subtle)
- If ouray.info has 0 reviews:
  - Show: “ouray.info: No ouray.info reviews yet” (no stars)
- If Google data exists:
  - Show: “Google: ★ 4.8 · 122 reviews” (stars should still use your fill style, but keep it compact)
- Keep both sources clearly labeled (ouray.info vs Google) but visually minimal.
- Keep your star fill rounding behavior unchanged (nearest 0.05 fill steps).

CONSTRAINTS
- Minimal edits; reuse existing components/styles.
- No new dependencies.
- Do not break existing routes or review functionality.
- Keep typography and spacing consistent.

DELIVERABLES
- List exact files you will modify before implementing.
- Implement all changes.
- Provide a quick test checklist:
  - Home page nav looks centered and Explore works
  - Sort dropdown has only 3 options and works
  - Attractions section appears over snowy image; Other moved to new solid block and text colors correct
  - Cards show “No ouray.info reviews yet”
  - Detail page rating section is simplified and elegant for both 0-review and reviewed businesses
