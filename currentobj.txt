OBJECTIVE: Improve contact page UX and site navigation with elegant, minimal changes.

TASK A — Top navigation link
- Add a "Contact" link to the top navigation row on the home page.
- The nav currently contains: Coffee, Restaurants, Shopping, Other.
- Place the "Contact" link on the FAR RIGHT of the row.
- Style it consistently with the existing nav (text-only, no buttons).
- Link target must be /contact/.
- Do not restructure or refactor the nav; minimal template/CSS changes only.

TASK B — Contact page hero background
- Update the /contact/ page so its background/hero matches the home page hero.
- Use the same image: abrams-image.jpg.
- Match existing hero overlay, blur, gradients, and typography so the page feels cohesive with the homepage.
- Do not duplicate large blocks of CSS; reuse existing hero styles where possible.

TASK C — Post-submit success page
- After a successful contact form submission, redirect the user to a new success page (e.g. /contact/success/ or equivalent).
- This page should:
  - Retain the same hero background (abrams-image.jpg).
  - Display a clear, elegant message: “Thanks! Your message has been received.”
  - Include a visually subtle but obvious link back to the home page.
- The page should feel calm, clean, and intentional (no alert boxes).
- Do not re-submit the form on refresh (use redirect-after-POST).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Do NOT change database models or migrations.
- Keep all changes minimal and localized.
- Ask before touching files outside the expected templates, views, urls, or CSS.
- Prioritize reuse of existing styles and structure.

DELIVERABLES:
- List the exact files you will modify or create before implementing.
- Implement all changes.
- Briefly explain how the redirect-after-submit flow works.
- Tell me what URLs I should test in the browser.
