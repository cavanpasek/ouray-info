Small UI consistency update:

On the /contact/ page, add the same “Back to home” bubble/button that already exists on the /contact/success/ page.

Requirements:
- Reuse the exact same markup and CSS styles used on the success page (do not restyle or duplicate logic).
- Place the button below the main contact page text/heading, in a visually consistent position.
- Link target should be /.
- Keep the button subtle and elegant (no hover overkill).
- Do not change form behavior, layout, or hero styling.
- Minimal changes only.

Files you may touch:
- contact.html
- shared CSS if needed (prefer reuse over duplication)

After implementing:
- Confirm the button looks identical on both /contact/ and /contact/success/.
