OBJECTIVE: Integrate Google Reviews into our existing Ouray Info review system while keeping native reviews enabled, and render star fills with precise rounding (nearest 0.05 of full width).

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT (Google API):
- Google Places/Place Details returns a maximum of 5 Google reviews per place (no pagination).
- Therefore, “Top 20 reviews” on the detail page must be achieved by combining:
  - OurayInfo approved reviews (unlimited)
  - Google reviews (up to 5)
- Do NOT scrape Google reviews. Use the official Google Places API only.
- Do NOT permanently store/copy Google review text in the database. Fetch live at request time (or short-lived in-memory cache only), to comply with Places content policies. (place_id can be stored.) 

TASK A — Add Google Place ID mapping to each Business
1) Add a field to Business:
- google_place_id (nullable/blank allowed)
2) Add an admin-friendly way to set it:
- Show google_place_id in Business admin list/detail.
- Optionally add a simple “lookup helper” management command or admin action (nice-to-have), but keep minimal.

TASK B — Fetch Google rating + reviews on business detail page
1) On business detail GET:
- If google_place_id exists:
  - Call Google Places API Place Details to fetch:
    - rating (average)
    - userRatingCount (count)
    - reviews (array; max 5)
    - optionally: url / googleMapsUri if available (to link “Read more on Google”)
- If google_place_id is missing:
  - Skip Google section gracefully (no errors).
2) API key:
- Read GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY from environment variables only.
- Do not hardcode keys.

TASK C — Display unified ratings + stars with 0.05 rounding
We have two rating sources:
- OurayInfo native reviews (approved only)
- Google rating (if available)

UI requirements:
1) On business detail page:
- Show BOTH sources clearly and elegantly, e.g.:
  - “Ouray.info rating: ★★★★☆ (4.35) · 12 reviews”
  - “Google rating: ★★★★☆ (4.40) · 87 reviews (Read on Google)”
- Keep it visually clean; don’t make it cluttered.

2) Star fill:
- Stars must fill left-to-right.
- The fill amount must round to nearest 0.05 of full width (i.e., 5% increments).
  - Example: fill_fraction = rating/5
  - rounded = round(fill_fraction / 0.05) * 0.05
  - percent = rounded * 100
- Implement with a CSS overlay fill approach (recommended):
  - 5 empty stars as base + filled stars clipped to width var(--fill-percent).
  - No new dependencies.

TASK D — “Top 20 reviews” on detail page (combined list)
Goal: Display up to 20 reviews total on the detail page, combining Google + OurayInfo reviews.

Rules:
1) OurayInfo reviews:
- Only approved reviews appear.
- Show rating, name (if any), date, comment.
2) Google reviews:
- Display what the API provides (author name, rating, relative time, text).
- Include “Powered by Google”/attribution if required by returned content / policy.
- Provide a “Read more on Google” link if we have a URL.
3) Combine into one list (max 20):
- If Google reviews exist, include them first under a “From Google” label OR interleave by recency if timestamps are available.
- Fill remaining slots with OurayInfo approved reviews until you reach 20.
- If total reviews < 20, show what exists (no empty placeholders).

TASK E — Business cards show BOTH Ouray and Google summary (compact)
On business listing cards:
- Keep it compact; do not make cards tall.
- Show:
  - OurayInfo stars + approved review count (if any)
  - If Google rating exists AND google_place_id is set, show a small “Google ★ 4.4 (87)” line or badge.
- Use the same star fill rounding logic (0.05 increments).

TASK F — Keep native reviews fully functional
- Users can still leave reviews on OurayInfo.
- OurayInfo review submission still uses reCAPTCHA + moderation approval flow as currently implemented.
- Approved OurayInfo reviews update OurayInfo aggregates and sorting.

TASK G — Sorting businesses (clarify which rating drives sorting)
Update default sorting rules:
- Primary: OurayInfo average rating (approved only), then OurayInfo review count.
- Secondary (tie-break or optional toggle): Google rating/userRatingCount if present.
- Add an optional sort dropdown:
  - Top Rated (Ouray) [default]
  - Top Rated (Google)
  - Most Reviewed (Ouray)
  - A–Z
Keep it elegant and minimal.

FILES EXPECTED TO TOUCH
- directory/models.py (Business.google_place_id)
- directory/admin.py (show/edit google_place_id)
- directory/views.py (detail page: fetch google data; cards: annotate/merge)
- directory/templates/... (business_detail.html + business cards partial)
- directory/static/.../site.css (stars fill component + small badge styles)
- config/settings.py (GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY env read)
- migrations (for google_place_id field)

DELIVERABLES
1) List exact files to change before implementing.
2) Implement Google integration and combined top-20 reviews display.
3) Implement star fill rounding to 0.05 increments and reuse it everywhere (detail + cards).
4) Provide env vars needed (GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY) and brief setup steps.
5) Provide test checklist and URLs to verify.

TEST CHECKLIST
- Business without google_place_id: page works, shows only OurayInfo reviews.
- Business with google_place_id: shows Google rating + up to 5 Google reviews + link to Google.
- Detail page shows up to 20 combined reviews total.
- Stars fill rounds in 5% increments (0.05) and fills left-to-right.
- Cards show compact rating summaries and still look elegant.
