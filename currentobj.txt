OBJECTIVE: UI polish + review/star display improvements + bookmarks navigation.

TASK A — Home hero subtitle spacing + remove “10 Listed”
1) On the home page hero:
- Move the subtitle under “ouray.info” DOWN slightly so it stays readable against the hero image (increase top margin/padding just a bit).
- Do not change the hero image, font family, or overall hero layout—just adjust spacing so white text doesn’t disappear.

2) Remove the “10 Listed” label from the UI entirely.
- Omit it from the template (not just hide it).

3) Move the “Sort: ____” control UP to replace where “10 Listed” was.
- The sort control should appear in that same spot in a clean, balanced way.
- Keep the control styling consistent with existing design.

TASK B — Add “Bookmarked” nav link + bookmarks page access
1) Add a “Bookmarked” link in the top row navigation on the home page (same row as Coffee/Restaurants/Shopping/Other/Contact).
- Label: “Bookmarked”
- It should be placed at the top with the other nav links (a normal nav item, not a button).
- Link target: /bookmarks/
- Styling should match existing nav links.

2) Ensure /bookmarks/ page is usable and matches the site style:
- Uses the same hero background style if other pages do.
- Shows user bookmarked businesses as cards (same card component).
- Includes star rating + review count on bookmarked cards (see TASK E).

TASK C — Business detail page: remove letter bubble + separate top-right action bubbles
1) On the business detail page:
- Remove the “letter bubble” in the top-right corner (omit from template).
- Keep “Visit Website” and “Bookmark/Bookmarked” in the top-right, but add spacing so the bubbles DO NOT touch.
- Maintain consistent bubble styling (same size/shape), just add gap/margin.

TASK D — Star fill display + review count on business detail page
1) For businesses with approved reviews:
- Show “# Reviews” to the LEFT (e.g., “12 reviews”).
- To the RIGHT of that, show a star rating bar using 5 stars that fill from left to right based on average rating (cool “*****” fill effect).
- Stars should visually fill (not just plain text). Make it elegant (match existing UI, not cartoonish).
- If there are 0 reviews, show something subtle like “No reviews yet” and do NOT show filled stars.

Implementation guidance:
- Use average rating (approved reviews only).
- Use a simple and stable rendering method:
  - Option A: 5 star icons with a CSS overlay fill based on percentage (recommended)
  - Option B: render filled vs empty stars based on rounding rules (acceptable)
- Keep it lightweight: no new dependencies.

TASK E — Show stars + review counts on business cards
1) On business listing cards (home/category lists and bookmarks list):
- Display average rating stars + review count (approved reviews only).
- Keep it compact and readable—ideally under the business name or near the meta line.
- If 0 reviews, show “No reviews yet” or omit the stars entirely (choose whichever looks more elegant).

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Do NOT change database schema (reviews model already exists).
- Keep changes minimal and localized.
- Reuse existing styles/components wherever possible; avoid duplicating large CSS blocks.

DELIVERABLES
- List exact files you will modify before implementing.
- Implement the changes.
- Provide a quick checklist of pages to test:
  - / (hero subtitle spacing, sort control location, “Bookmarked” link, cards show stars)
  - /bookmarks/ (cards show stars)
  - business detail page (no letter bubble, action bubbles spaced, star fill + review count)
